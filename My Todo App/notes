What all interactions will the Todo App perform?

1. get all todos
2. add a todo
3. complete a todo (modifying it)
4. delete a todo

Homework : See RESTful API's
 Concept of REST guides you towards how your API's should look like

1. get all todos
   http://localhost:4000/todos/GET

   todos/GET
   //Returns a JSON object of all our todos

2. delete a todo (modifying it)
   http://localhost:4000/todos/:id DELETE

3. complete a todo
   http://localhost:4000/todos



The Server has 2 parts :
1. The part which handles views
2. The part which handles data


- Read about data.* custom attributes

- Use of innerHTML is discouraged. Figure out better ways which are encouraged

// If you want to run a function everytime the page loads, then use window.onload or document.onload
// Homework - Subtle differences between : window.onload and document.onload
// window.onload - more widely supported
//window.onload = getTodosAJAX();
